<b>Abstract</b>

This dissertation is focused on the study and on the implementation of an authentication system and of the management of permissions based on the blockchain technology. This system is realized minding an architecture (MyData) and it’s built to be a generic and reusable module.
The project developed allows the authentication of a registered Account on the Ethereum blockchain and the sending of data transactions. The transactions are then confirmed and saved in the blockchain, saving in the blockchain the user preference about his/her personal data.
The presented work is an extension of the Valentina Protti’s project, which is been extended by inserting the authentication and the sending of transactions to a blockchain through the Uport project.
Inside the dissertation is presented the analysis process and the realization process about the development of the software used for the authentication and the sending of transaction and the integration in the starting project.
It’s also presented an analysis of the future possible evolution and growth of the project.
